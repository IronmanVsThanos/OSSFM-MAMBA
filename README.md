> **Overcoming Roadside View Data Scarcity: Harnessing Vision Foundation Models for Traffic Scene Parsing**

## 🔥 News
- [2024-12] Manuscript under review, codebase will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance.
- [2024-12] Initial repository setup and documentation.

## 📋 Overview

This project introduces an innovative Adaptive Token Modulator (ATM) strategy that effectively leverages Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to address data scarcity in roadside-view traffic scene parsing. Key features:

- 🚀 **High Efficiency**: Achieves SOTA performance with 78.9% mIoU on TSP6K with only 2.5% trainable parameters (7.7M)
- 💡 **Innovation**: First application of VFMs to roadside traffic scene parsing
- 🌟 **Strong Generalization**: Excellent performance in few-shot scenarios
- 🎯 **Practical Value**: Superior performance in challenging conditions (e.g., night scenes)

## 🗂️ Main Contributions

1. Construction of the **RS2K** dataset for roadside-view traffic scene parsing
2. Introduction of the novel **Adaptive Token Modulator (ATM)** strategy
3. Achievement of outstanding cross-scenario generalization capability
